# Python-TextToSpeech

I made a python project which is used to convert text message to audio.
I used pyttsx3 module to complete this project.
This project was made since this was very helpful for me as I can use this to write my classworks.
Using this I don't need to see the moniter often, so that I can't be distracted.

Thank you.
